# Gemini-Ai
This project is a clone of Google Gemini built using React.js and integrates with Google's Generative AI API (@google/generative-ai). It allows users to input prompts and receive intelligent, AI-generated responses in real-time â€” simulating conversational or creative interactions similar to Google's Gemini.
