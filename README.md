# Gemini-Ai

This project is a clone of Google Gemini built using **React.js + Vite** and integrates with Google's Generative AI API (`@google/generative-ai`). It allows users to input prompts and receive intelligent, AI-generated responses in real-time â€” simulating conversational or creative interactions similar to Google's Gemini.

## Tech Stack
